# My Own Website

I wanted to make a personal, professional website for a while, and this project will (hopefully) grow into a professional, fun,
and slick website to highlight my work, my skills, my research, and my interests.

## Tools and Technologies Used

Since making a static site is boring, I decided to use this project to learn and get comfortable with
some popular modern technologies. This is definitely overkill, but here's a quick overview of the project:

### List of Tools
1. Docker: All development was done in a docker container. (more details to follow - took a while to figure out correct Docker dev setup, especially on Windows.)
2. React App created using the create-react-app tool, then ejected
3. React router
4. React Hot Reload
5. Reactstrap (For Bootstrap 4 support)
6. Theme based on https://bootstrapious.com/p/screen-onepage-scroll-theme
7. (more details to follow)

### List of Tutorials / Other Resources Instrumental in the Project
1. https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
2. http://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/using-docker-for-flask-application-development-not-just-production/
3. http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html
4. https://www.andrewhfarmer.com/getting-started-tutorials/
5. https://medium.com/@baphemot/understanding-react-deployment-5a717d4378fd
6. Many tedious google searches to find and digest stackoverflow answers, github issue threads, etc.
7. (so many more to list)

### The Process


#### Learning to Use (and even enjoy) Docker and Docker Compose

#### Setting up a React Development Container
(and overcoming many frustrations)

##### Volumes: Key to developing in a docker container

##### Windows volumes: ensuring file monitorung works

##### Setting up Docker container for interactive shell access

##### Dealing with required packages using Yarn

##### React Router: non-static routes!

##### React Hot Reload: See your changes immediately!
